# Food Finder

Many people often take where they live for granted, even in urban locales surrounded by stores and restaurants and can end up missing out on some nearby neighbourhood gems.  Or perhaps they just don't want to get in a car, or Uber, to dine out at one of the better known restaurants. The purpose of our product is to provide the user with options for great restaurants within a convenient walking distance from their home; just around the corner.

3/ When the user clicks on the restaurant button, that click calls the function that pulls information from a combination of the Open Route API, and Google Maps to display walking directions to that restaurant.

4/ At the same time, the button click saves the user's search history into local storage so that when the user returns to the restaurant directory, the user's search history will be displayed.
